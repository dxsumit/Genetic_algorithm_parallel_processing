<b> Problem Statement Taken: </b> Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are adaptive heuristic search algorithms that belong to the larger
part of evolutionary algorithms. Genetic algorithms are based on the ideas of natural
selection and genetics. <br>
These are intelligent exploitation of random search provided with historical data to direct the
search into the region of better performance in solution space.<br>
Genetic algorithms simulate the process of natural selection which means those species
who can adapt to changes in their environment are able to survive and reproduce and go to
next generation. In simple words, they simulate “survival of the fittest” among individual of
consecutive generation for solving a problem. Each generation consist of a population of
individuals and each individual represents a point in search space and possible solution.
Each individual is represented as a class object. In class object there is string which is
analogous to the Chromosome. <br> <br>
